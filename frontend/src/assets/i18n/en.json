    "title1":"Working out at the gym, no matter what type of fitness you prefer, can be a great way to stay in shape. However, we recommend that, when the weather allows it, you go outside a little and choose one of the sports that you can do recreationally. Many of these sports can be played indoors or outdoors, so you don't have to worry about the weather. In addition, recreational sports contribute to faster burning of calories, relieve stress and promote a sense of community. So gather the team and go to football, basketball, tennis, running, because these activities can bring you many benefits.",
